The purpose of this paper is to improve the final process of digitalization of
UFF undergraduate students' files carried out by the Reprographic Laboratory
(LARE), because everything that is digitized is decentralized in several computers,
requiring that a person gather this data and manually transfer them to the computers
located at the Dean of Graduation (PROGRAD), where they will be research objects.
This requires weekly backups and spreadsheet tracking to keep track of what has
been updated. Thus, the goal is to develop web software capable of integrating the
activity performed in LARE with the need of PROGRAD, facilitating the archiving and
consultation of these documents. The MySQL database will be responsible for managing the information and the Web will be the means of access, making communication between LARE and PROGRAD an automated process avoiding duplication of
data, reducing the potential risks of data loss during transfer, and making the query a
simple and quick action.
